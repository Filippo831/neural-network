# neural network from scatch
trying to build a neural network using c from scratch


# TODO
## MUST
- [ ] insert type of layer into the layer type, figure out what return type to use. Probably it's a good idea to make error struct common between all activation functions to avoid issues
- [ ] make the forward propagation function
- [ ] make the backpropagation function
- [ ] create the convolutional type of layer
- [ ] make the neural network easily configurable

## MAYBE
- [ ] insert the type of activation function inside the layer struct to change it dynamically
